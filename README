Timing Information
===

Encryption:
It took 1.495 seconds to encrypt 363264 bytes using our encryption function
Thus, the bytes/second bandwidth for encryption is around 242985.9531772575 bytes/second
Thus, the MB/second bandwidth for decryption is around 0.232 MB/second

Decryption:
It took 1.447 seconds to encrypt 363264 bytes using our encryption function
Thus, the bytes/second bandwidth for decryption is around 251046.3026952315 bytes/second
Thus, the MB/second bandwidth for decryption is around .239 MB/second
